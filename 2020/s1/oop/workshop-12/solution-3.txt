Shield Functionality:

Check if a given key is pressed for example 's' for shield.

if(input == 's'){
	//Call a function of the spaceship object that makes it invulnerable
	spaceship -> becomeInvulnerable();
}

//Check the spaceship objects vulnerable state when it collides with an asteroid to see if the player should lose:

if(spaceshipPosition == asteroidPosition && spaceship -> getVulnerability() == false){
	gameover = true;
}
