Pac Man Game Plan:

1. Build empty board and display to terminal using cout.

2. Create "entity" base class for Pacman and all ghosts to inherit from:
- Has a row and column position
- Can move based on a user input
- Can access the position of any entity using int getrow() and int getcolumn()

3. Create a "Pacman" subclass of entity:
- Pacman has an additional score variable
- Pacman can return the score through "int getScore()"
- Pacman can increment the score when eating pellets by calling "void scorePellet"
- Similarly for a ghost with "void scoreGhost"

4. Create a "Maze" class:
- Stores a 2D array of ints that represent each space
- Has a function that displays the map
- Has a function that updates positions in the map after "entities" have moved
- Has a function that can return what number is within a specific coordinate in the array.

5. Create a "Ghost" class:
- Superclass with virtual functions for chase and scatter (these functions vary dependant on the colour of ghost)
- Has common functionality: scared and eaten (triggered after pacman collects a superpellet and after pacman eats a ghost respectively)
- Has a private "pathing" function that moves the ghost while obeying the rules:
	- Ghost cannot backtrack / cannot turn 180Ëš in one move.
	- Ghost cannot walk through walls.
	- Ghost should always move towards the target space unless there is a wall or it must backtrack.

6. Create a "Red" subclass of Ghost:
- Has a specific chase and scatter function.
- Find the specific behaviour through research.
- Is released into the maze after x moves.

7. Create a "Blue" subclass of Ghost:
- Has a specific chase and scatter function.
- Find the specific behaviour through research.
- Is released into the maze after x moves.

8. Create a "Pink" subclass of Ghost:
- Has a specific chase and scatter function.
- Find the specific behaviour through research.
- Is released into the maze after x moves.

9. Create an "Orange" subclass of Ghost:
- Has a specific chase and scatter function.
- Find the specific behaviour through research.
- Is released into the maze after x moves.

10. Add functionality to the super pellet:
- Allows pacman to eat any ghost
- Lasts a finite amount of moves: Find the number through research.

11. Win condition and Loss Condition
- Lose if ghost and pacman coincide 
- Win if all the pellets are gone
