Testing 5:
- Added procedural generation to the maze object so that each time the program is run a new map is created.

Rules for generation:
- paths can only be one unit wide.
- the map is symmetrical about its vertical centre line
- the map always has 8 portals on its boundaries that are symmetrical about the centre of the map
- the map is approximately 1/3 pellets
